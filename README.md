# BG_Travel-MOD-for-BG1-BGEE-BGT-Tutu-EET
New travel system between Baldur's Gate City areas

Author: Zed Nocear (zed_nocear@wp.pl) 

Version: 2.1 

Language: all 

Game: BG1, BGEE, BGT, Tutu, EET


  This is a mini-mod of the "rules&tweaks" type for "vanilla" BG1 (with or without the add-on Tales of the Sword Coast), BGEE,
  BG1Tutu, BGT and EET. It changes the travel system in Baldur's Gate City and between both parts of Isle of Balduran from
  access via the "main map" to access via a "travel region - entrance" system, like the entrances to the indoor sub-locations.
  The new way of travel is more natural. The party exits one area to appear in the parallel place of the nearest location, and
  not always at the same set entry point as it was before. The other benefit of this system is access to two small areas of
  Baldur's Gate City, which were otherwise unreachable.
  
  The travel is executed immediately, without the use of the main map. The party can pass only to the bordering location.
  For example, if you want to go from the Elfsong Tavern to the Hall of Wonders, you must cross all areas between the east
  and west sections of the city, passing through the inner city gate. The main map appears only if you go through the east gate
  of the city. I hope that all locations of Baldur's Gate will now give an impression of being one big, cohesive area.

  This modification does not add any new text to the game. It adds about 62 new entrances and 79 travel regions to the locations
  of BG city and Isle of Balduran. It modifies and does not replace ARE files, therefore it should be compatible with all other
  WeiDU mods. If the modification will be installed during the game, will work only on not yet visited locations.

  HINT: The road through the sewers can significantly speed up the traveling around Baldur's Gate.

  Optional minimalistic version of modification provide the access to two unreachable areas of Baldur's Gate City only, no other
  traveling between maps is changed.
